# gulp_v2

This is my second gulp builder. 
This functionality includes minification of images and html, css, js files, as well as compiling scss file into css.
Instructions for use:
1. Download and add these files to the root of your project.
2. Run: npm i -y
4. Now in the object 'paths' change paths to your files to be processed.
5. Run the command: gulp build

When the assembler finishes, you will have a dist folder in your project. It will contain all the files that have been minified and compiled.
